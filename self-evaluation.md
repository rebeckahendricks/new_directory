How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- I feel pretty confident in arrays and calling basic methods on arrays. I thought I had a struggle with running my file, but it turns out that I was doing that correctly and just needed to implement my `puts` command to see the rest of my commands.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

- Not really, because I can tell that I will get more practice with these skills to feel more fluent in future assignments.

What questions do you have about arrays?

- I would just like to know more about how they are used, but I think that will come in the future.
